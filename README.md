 # Description 
 I wanted to adhere to the scope of the assignment, but I also implemented a MATLAB visualizer to demonstrate the volume calculation visually, aiming to stand out as a candidate.

 # Installation requirements, if not already installed.
 pip install setuptools matplotlib numpy
 
 # To run and install the package
 CD PATH/TO/foo_parameterization
 
 pip install .
 
 foo_parameterization 100



 # To uninstall the package
 pip uninstall foo_parameterization

 # Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the `unittest` module from the command line:

python -m unittest discover -s foo_parameterization/tests

# Examples below


 # Sample 1, Positive Radius, no visualizer:

 Command line: 
 foo-parameterization 100

 Output:
