# Foo Parameterization Project

Welcome to the Foo Parameterization project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive implementation of the Foo et al. parameterization for calculating and visualizing the volume of spheres.

## Features

- Calculate the volume of a sphere using the Foo et al. parameterization.
- Optionally visualize the sphere in 3D using Matplotlib.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Modular design for easy extension and maintenance.

## Quick Start

To get started with using the Foo Parameterization project, see the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for instructions on how to install and set up the project.
